\section{Fundamental Solutions to the Wave Equation}

\subsection{Lorentz invariance of fundamental solution}
Last time, we were solving the wave equation
where
$$
\begin{aligned}
\square &=\partial_{t}^{2}-\Delta_{x} \\
&=m^{\alpha, \beta} \partial_{\alpha} \partial_{\beta}
\end{aligned}
$$
in coordinates $t=x_{0}$ and $\partial_{t}=\partial_{0}$. The matrix $M$ is given by
$$
M=\left[\begin{array}{llll}
-1 & & & \\
& 1 & & \\
& & \ddots & \\
& & & 1
\end{array}\right]
$$
Last time, we determined that a fundamental solution is homogeneous of order $1-n$ and must move forward in time. We looked at symmetries of the equation when we make a linear change of coordinates $x=A y$. We saw that such a linear change of coordinates leaves $\square$ unchanged if and only if
$$
A^{\top} M A=M
$$
This is a group, called the \textbf{Lorentz group}; if $M$ were the identity matrix, this would be the group or orthogonal matrices. What are the generators for this group?

\begin{itemize}
    \item[1.] Rigid rotations: $A=\left[\begin{array}{ll}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0\end{array}\right]$, where $O$ is an $n \times n$ orthogonal matrix. These were the symmetries corresponding to the Laplacian.
    \item[2.] Look at $1+1$ dimensions and leave the rest unchanged: Since we can apply rotations to the last $n$ dimensions, we only need to mix the time dimension and the first space dimension. Observe that
    $$
    \left[\begin{array}{ll}
    a & c \\
    b & d
    \end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
    -1 & 0 \\
    0 & 1
    \end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{ll}
    a & b \\
    c & d
    \end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
    -1 & 0 \\
    0 & 1
    \end{array}\right]
    $$
    If $-1$ were 1 , we would get rotations:
    $$
    A=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
    \cos \theta & \sin \theta \\
    -\sin \theta & \cos \theta
    \end{array}\right]=\text { rotation by angle } \theta
    $$
    This keeps $t^{2}+x^{2}$ unchanged; this is like rotating around a point in a circle by angle $\theta$.
    With the $-1$, we get
$$
A=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\cosh \varphi & \sinh \varphi \\
\sinh \varphi & \cosh \varphi
\end{array}\right]=\text { hyperbolic rotation by angle } \varphi
$$
Such matrices keep $t^{2}-x^{2}$ unchanged. Rather than circles, here's what the level sets look like:
\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{pics/20-2.png}
\end{figure}
Here, we dilate the $t=x$ direction and shrink the $t=-x$ direction. This suggests that we make a change of variables $u=t+x$ and $v=-x .$ Then $\partial_{t}^{2}-\partial_{x}^{2}=4 \partial_{u} \partial_{v}$. Then the transformation $u \mapsto \lambda u, v \mapsto \lambda^{-1} v$ preserves the operator in this null frame.
\end{itemize}

\begin{theorem}
    The Lorentz group is generated by rigid spatial rotations and 1-d hyperbolic rotations.
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
    Hyperbolic rotations are sometimes referred to as Lorentz boosts. These hyperbolic rotations are what happens in special relativity when you switch between observers in different reference frames.
\end{remark}

We say that the solution to the wave equation is \textbf{Lorentz invariant}.

\subsection{Calculation of fundamental solutions}
We now know that the fundamental solution of the wave equation should be a "function" of $t^{2}-x^{2} .$ Here is what the picture should look like in higher dimensions.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{pics/20-3.png}
\end{figure}

The level sets should be forward and backward cones and hyperboloids. We get 1-sheeted and 2-sheeted hyperboloids. On the 1-sheeted hyperboloids, the forward in time points are connected to the backwards in time points, which must give 0 for our forward time solution. So these must be 0 . Thus, $K=K\left(t^{2}-x^{2}\right)=K(y)$ must be supported in the forward cone $\left\{t^{2}-x^{2} \geq 0\right\}$ We want a homogeneous distribution of $y$ which is $\frac{1-n}{2}$ homogeneous (since we are now working with the squares of $t, x$ ) and supported in $y \geq 0$.

\begin{itemize}
    \item In 1 dimension, we want a homogeneous distribution of order 0 , supported where $y>0$. So $K(y)=c H(y)$, and we saw earlier that this constant is $c=1 / 2$.
    \item In 2-dimensions, we want a homogeneous distribution of order $-1 / 2$, supported where $y>0 .$ So we get
    $$
    K(y)= \begin{cases}c_{2} \frac{1}{\sqrt{y}} & y>0 \\ 0 & y \leq 0\end{cases}
    $$
    So we get
    $$
    K(t, x)=c_{2} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\left(t^{2}-x^{2}\right)_{+}}} 1_{t \geq 0}
    $$
    \item In 3 -dimensions, we cannot get a function which is homogeneous of order $-1$. The two distributions that span the space of homogeneous distributions of order $-1$ are $\delta_{0}$ and PV $\frac{1}{y}$. The latter is supported everywhere, so we take $K(y)=\delta_{y=0}$
    $$
    K(t, x)=c_{3} \delta_{t^{2}-x^{2}=0} 1_{t \geq 0}
    $$
    \item In 4 dimensions, we need homogeneity of order $-3 / 2$. However, $\frac{1}{y_{+}^{3 / 2}} \notin L_{\text {loc }}^{1}$. Define
    $$
    \frac{1}{y_{+}^{3 / 2}}:=-2 \partial_{y} \frac{1}{y_{+}^{1 / 2}}
    $$
    This is a distribution, not a function. We can repeat this differentiation procedure to get a solution for all even dimensions.
    \item In 5 dimensions, we can get a solution which is homogeneous of order -2 by differentiating $\delta_{y=0}$. We can keep differentiating to get solutions in all odd dimensions.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Determination of constants for fundamental solutions}
Here is a formal computation: If $\square u=f$, let's see how $\int u d x$ behaves as a function of time.
$$
\begin{gathered}
\frac{d}{d t} \int u d x=\int u_{t} d x \\
\frac{d^{2}}{d t^{2}} \int u d x=\int u_{t t} d x=\int \Delta_x u+f d x=\int f d x,
\end{gathered}
$$
since we can get rid of the Laplacian using integration by parts. If $f=\delta_{0}$ and $u=K$, then $u=0$ for $t<0$, so
$$
I(t)=\int u d x=0 \quad \text { for all } t<0.
$$
Additionally, we get
$$
I^{\prime \prime}(t)=\delta_{t=0}.
$$
This tells us that
$$
I(t)=t 1_{t \geq 0}.
$$
so
$$
\int K(t, x) d x=t.
$$

\begin{itemize}
    \item In 2 dimensions, we have
    $$
    K(t, x)=\frac{c_{2}}{\sqrt{\left(t^{2}-x^{2}\right)_{+}}}
    $$
    so the equation
    $$
    t=c_{2} \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{\left(t^{2}-x^{2}\right)_{+}}} d x
    $$
    holds for all $t$. if we set $t=1$, then we get
    $$
    1=c_{2} \int_{B(0,1)} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-r^{2}}} r d r d \theta=c_{2} 2 \pi\left[-\sqrt{1-r^{2}}\right]_{0}^{1}
    $$
    which tells us that
    $$
    c_{2}=\frac{1}{2 \pi} .
    $$

    \item In 3 dimensions, we want to find $c_{3}$. What is $\delta_{t^{2}-x^{2}} ?$
    $$
    \delta_{0}=\frac{1}{2 \pi i}\left(\frac{1}{y-i 0}-\frac{1}{y+i 0}\right)
    $$
    so we can write
    $$
    \delta_{t^{2}-x^{2}}=\frac{1}{2 \pi i}\left(\frac{1}{t^{2}-x^{2}+i 0}-\frac{1}{t^{2}-x^{2}-i 0}\right)
    $$
    Note that
    $$
    \frac{1}{t^{2}-x^{2}}= \frac{1}{t-|x|} \frac{1}{t+|x|},
    $$
    where the left term vanishes on the cone, and $t+|x|$ is $2 t$ on the cone. so we can write
    $$
    \delta_{t^{2}-x^{2}=0}=\underbrace{\delta_{t=|x|}}_{\text {surface measure on }|x|=t} \cdot \frac{1}{2 t}
    $$
    If we have a surface $\Sigma=\{\phi=0\}$, this is like normalizing to make $|\nabla \phi|=1$
    The computation becomes
    $$
    \begin{gathered}
    K(t, x)=c_{3} \frac{1}{t} \delta_{|x|=t} \\
    t=\int \frac{c_{3}}{t} \delta_{|x|=t} d x=\frac{c_{3}}{t} \underbrace{\operatorname{Area}(\{|x|=t\})}_{=4 \pi t^{2}} .
    \end{gathered}
    $$
    so we get
    $$
    c_{3}=\frac{1}{4 \pi}
    $$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Physical interpretation of solutions to the wave equation}

Here are two key properties of the wave equation: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item [1.] All forward solutions are supported on the forward cone. This is referred as the finite speed of propagation. This says that waves move with speed $\leq 1$. If we normalize the equation with physical constants to get $c^{2} \partial_{t}^{2}-\Delta_{x}$, where $c$ is the speed of light, then this says that no waves move faster than the speed of light. An observer at position $x$ only observes the wave at the time at which the cone hits the observer's timeline:
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{pics/20-4.png}
    \end{figure}
    \item Consider 3 dimensions, where the fundamental solution $K$ is supported exactly on the cone. Here, waves hit the observer just once, and we don't see them again. This is called the Huygens principle.
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}
    The equations of physics are nonlinear; this linear PDE is just the best linear approximation. The finite speed of propagation remains, but Huygenâ€™s principle does not hold in general. When scientists observed gravitational waves recently, they observed both a Dirac mass and a nonlinear tail.

\end{remark}

\subsection{Next steps: Fourier series}
Our next goal is to learn about the connection between the Fourier transform and Fourier series. The Fourier transform $\widehat{u}$ of $u: \mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is given by
$$
u(x)=\int \widehat{u}(\xi) e^{i x \cdot \xi} d \xi
$$
\text { In calculus, you may have encountered Fourier series: }

\begin{definition}
    [Fourier series]
    If $u:[0,2 \pi] \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$, then the Fourier series for $u$ is given by $u(x)=\sum_{n} c_{n} e^{i n x}=\sum_{n} c_{n}(\cos (n x)+i \sin (n x))$
\end{definition}
Not all PDEs can be solved; we will see more about this next time.
