\chapter{Matrix-Vector Multiplication}

Given a matrix $A\in \CC^{m\times n}$, The range of $A$ is: 
\[
    \range(A) = \{Ax| x\in \CC^n\}.  
\]
Hence, $\range(A)$ is the space spanned by the columns of $A$.  The column rank of a matrix is the dimension of its column space and the row rank of a matrix is the dimension of the space spanned by its rows. Row rank always equals column rank.
